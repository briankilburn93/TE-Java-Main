	 * deviates from standard Java method naming conventions by using underscores
	 * between words instead of camelCase. This is my own personal convention and
	 * should not be construed as a general standard or convention. You can also
	 * use camelCase for test method names. You should follow the norm at whatever
	 * development organization you join.
	 *
	 * Regardless of whether you use camelCase or underscores, your method names
	 * should be very descriptive to the point of being overly verbose. This is fine
	 * because you will never write code to invoke your test methods, they are only
	 * invoked by the JUnit framework, hence descriptive trumps concise.
	 *
	 * Test methods always:
	 *     - are public
	 *     - return void
	 *     - take no arguments
