# Project Organizer Database Access - Individual Exercise

### Note: This is a two part exercise - Part 1 is done one day, Part 2 the next.
<br>

## Part 1 - Tuesday - Data Access Objects (DAO)

**Setup:** Create a PostgreSQL database and dbVisualizer connection using the attached SQL script `projects.sql`. 

Complete the CLI application for the project database by implementing the `JDBCDepartmentDAO`, `JDBCEmployeeDAO`, and `JDBCProjectDAO`.

## Part 2 Wednesday - Integration Testing

Using the same project usd for Day 1, create a JUnit Test case for the **Project Organizer Database** application. Implement integration tests for the `JDBCDepartmentDAO`, `JDBCEmployeeDAO`, and `JDBCProjectDAO` classes.

Be sure to clean up any test data so that the database is returned to its original state after the test is completed.

There is already a JUnit Test Case in the `src/test/java' folder which you may use as a model for setting up your new JUnit Test Case (or not).  **This is NOT where you put your solution.**  You should create a **NEW** JUnit Test Case for the solution to this exercise.
